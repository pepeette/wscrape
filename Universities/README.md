In In college counseling, a common challenge is matching students with universities that best fit their unique profiles. 
Each university and program has different weightings for various factors in student applications. 
To address this:
- I developed a big data solution that analyzes admission criteria across global universities.
- This tool considers each university's preferences for different majors and career paths.
- It matches these with individual student profiles, highlighting their unique strengths.


The result: Students can showcase their idiosyncratic traits more effectively, leading to higher success rates in university applications.
This approach is leading to : more efficiency in the department, higher information value given to parents and students, and sharper letters, we will see the quantified results at the school year end.
