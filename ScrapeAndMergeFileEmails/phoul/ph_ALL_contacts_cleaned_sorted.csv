During our visit, Mr. Arnel provided exceptional hospitality by accommodating us well and even providing snacks for us and Ms. Yen. His attentiveness added to the positive experience of the meeting.

The purpose of this meeting was to introduce Mr. Arnel to our updated Suniture products, Agora fabrics, and materials for fiberglass umbrellas. Previously, Amorita Resort had shown interest in Sunbrella products, hence the need to present our alternatives.

Discussion Points:

Suniture Collections: We showcased our latest Suniture furniture products to Mr. Arnel, giving him an overview of the available options for their resort.

Agora Fabrics: We highlighted the advantages and features of Agora fabrics as an alternative to Sunbrella, addressing their previous inquiries and providing them with more options.

Fiberglass Umbrella Materials: We presented the materials used in our fiberglass umbrellas, emphasizing their durability and suitability for outdoor settings.

Expansion Plans:
During the meeting, Mr. Arnel expressed Amorita Resort's intentions to expand, which includes acquiring additional umbrellas.","Recommendations for Sightseeing:
Mr. Arnel shared that they have a romantic dinner spot on the premises, which may appear dull on days without bookings. He requested recommendations for products that can enhance the ambiance during regular days, providing guests with an opportunity for sightseeing and enjoying the beautiful surroundings.

Visit By Roseanne","Amorita Resort is under Hacienda Primera Development Corporation and managed by the boutique hotel group One-Of Collection.

During our visit, Mr. Arnel provided exceptional hospitality by accommodating us well and even providing snacks for us and Ms. Yen. His attentiveness added to the positive experience of the meeting.

The purpose of this meeting was to introduce Mr. Arnel to our updated Suniture products, Agora fabrics, and materials for fiberglass umbrellas. Previously, Amorita Resort had shown interest in Sunbrella products, hence the need to present our alternatives.

Discussion Points:

Suniture Collections: We showcased our latest Suniture furniture products to Mr. Arnel, giving him an overview of the available options for their resort.

Agora Fabrics: We highlighted the advantages and features of Agora fabrics as an alternative to Sunbrella, addressing their previous inquiries and providing them with more options.

Fiberglass Umbrella Materials: We presented the materials used in our fiberglass umbrellas, emphasizing their durability and suitability for outdoor settings.

Visit By Rosa Lee","This is another fixed canopy project with approximately 600-800 yards. Sunbrella awning and marine fabric had been presented by France prior to my visit in order for us to be included on the bidding process. This is a joined project with Cedorada Glass and Aluminum Supplies company who is a canopy frame maker. I already did a joined project with them in the past where Suniture had supplied, sewn and installed 21 yards of AM fabric to one restaurant in Makati. Cedorada is not as big as Limkaco but they provide the same type of services. Cedorada submitted the quotation for the frame works whilst BVZ Asia submitted the quotation for the Sunbrella fabric supply. However, customer wanted only to speak to one supplier who can make the package to include canopy frame and Sunbrella fabric installation. Cedorada refused to do it so I have decided to combined both quotations. Still for further study and follow-up.",- Sunbrella AM fabric swatches given to Architect Charie,3,eo_assistant@yahoo.com,Cristina Dorego,

Charisma Elliz S. Santos

Visit By Roseanne","Ms. Charisma emailed me for their parasols requirement. Below is the wind capacity they want.

Option 1 â€“ can withstand wind load of 60 kph to 80 kph
Option 2 â€“ can withstand wind load of 80 kph to 100 kph
Option 3 â€“ can withstand wind load of 100 kph to 120 kph


This project is for Manila Bay, however upon checking with our existing parasol we only have upto Beaufort 5 or 38 kph.

Ms. Patricia Danica Gozum

Visit By Roseanne","Despite being unable to reach Mr. Salvador, the purchasing manager at Belmont Hotel, I took the initiative to visit the premises and had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Patricia.

During our interaction, I introduced her to our range of Suniture products, including our specially highlighted Suniture On-Sale Items. To provide a tangible glimpse of our offerings, I showcased our Placemats and an Umbrella that are available in Taguig.

Additionally, I took the opportunity to introduce our outdoor cushions, explaining their anatomy and quality features to Ms. Patricia.

Upon our discussion, she expressed interest in elevating our proposal to the management for further consideration. Furthermore, she mentioned the possibility of requiring additional samples, indicating that she would reach out accordingly.

She was familiar with sunbrella as she told me that they are using sunbrella before. I educated her about sunbrella and discussed with her also our other products and services.

She told me that they started the renovation for KFC store last 2009. Almost all the store for KFC is company owned and also for mister donut.

She mentioned to me that mister donut in Bacolod City was closed due to low profit and they changed it to KFC which they opened it last 2 months ago. She said that they have an outdoor set up at second floor area which they put up an umbrella. They bought 3sets from First Pinnacle.

She was asking if I can leave to her our colored card for FF and AM so she can show it to their designer. I told her that I would leave them for their reference. They have a new store for KFC which will be opened early next year in Quezon Avenue. She will see if they will put an outdoor setting.

Some stores also for KFC have a fixed awning and she told me that if ever there's a need for replacement she will contact us.",-keep in touch with her for future project,2,evelyn.velicaria@qualservcentral.com,Evelyn P. Velicaria,Evelyn P. Velicaria

During my visit, I met Mr. Ray, a junior architect at the firm. I had the opportunity to briefly discuss our Suniture products with him, including umbrellas and throw pillows. I also detailed the features of our fabrics, including Agora Upholstery, Sauleda fabrics, Eqomare, Eqpdry foam, and UV threads.

I mentioned that we have already supplied outdoor umbrellas and fabric to several establishments in Cebu, such as Shangri-La Cebu, Sheraton Cebu, Crimson, and Jpark, as well as to some furniture makers. Mr. Ray then provided the card details of their architect responsible for project specifications, who will review our materials.

Apart from extreme sports amenities, it also has rooms,cabanas and cottages offered as accommodation especially for foreign guests and spectators with also some locals visiting.

1. They are happy and excited to know what we can offer as a company mainly because they've been looking for outdoor suppliers especially for sail shades. Informed them that we do have fabrics specifically for this but labor & installation is provided by a sub con. They are amenable to this.

2. They already know Sunbrella as a brand, possible requirements besides the sail shade are bean bags, umbrellas and fabric for the rooms and cabanas. All of these will be discussed with the entire management and will contact us soon as the requirements are finalized.

Ms. Merlyn Carlota

Visit By Roseanne","I recently had the pleasure of visiting Caï¿½izares Architects Design Company (CAD Co.), an architectural corporation with a mission to become a leading architectural firm in the Philippines. During my visit, I met with Ms. Merlyn Carlota, the administrative head of the firm. Unfortunately, there were no architects available to meet with me at that time, but Ms. Carlota kindly offered to discuss our offerings with me and forward the information to her team.

During our meeting, I had the opportunity to discuss our BVZ offerings and product line of fabrics with Ms. Carlota. I provided her with a comprehensive overview of our range of fabrics, from Agora Fabric down to UV Threads.

Ms. Carlota was an attentive listener, and she asked several insightful questions about the features of our outdoor fabrics. I was able to provide her with detailed information on the durability, weather resistance, and other key features of our fabrics.

In addition to discussing our fabrics, I also introduced Ms. Carlota to our Suniture Products and highlighted our impressive client list of hotels and resorts here in Cebu.","Based on our conversation, Ms. Carlota expressed interest in a full product presentation with her team, which could potentially lead to future collaboration between our companies and she will let me know the schedule as soon as available. I look forward to the opportunity to present our offerings to the team at CAD Co. and explore potential avenues for partnership.

The adjustment involved replacing the 7 units with 38mm tubes to 48mm tubes, as we had swapped the Lanta25 bases to a round shape. We repurposed the square fiberglass bases for the FIJ25 models.

Visit By Dustin","In the year 1960, Engr. Delfin M Wenceslao Sr. started with the vision to bring forward the country urban landscape. D.M. Wenceslao and Associates Inc. (DMWAI) as an individual proprietorship. Five years later, DMWAI was incorporated. Today, it is licensed by the Philippine Licensing Board as Category AAAA with classifications as General Engineering and General Building.

Ms. Christina first introduced our company as a distributor of outdoor and indoor fabrics for upholstery, awnings, marine use and umbrellas. Then, she proceeded to discuss the various types of umbrellas, including options for centerpole shapes (round and square) and different sizes. She also showcased the hanging umbrella.
On my part, I explained the 100% Solution Dyed-Acrylic and differentiated it from yarn-dyed fabrics. I mentioned the features of Agora fabrics, such as water repellency, stain resistance, mold resistance and UV resistance. I also informed them that Agora fabrics are ideal for upholstery use because they are softer. Additionally, I showcased the Sauleda fabrics and explained that they are best used for awnings, marine applications, and umbrella covers because they are stiffer and can withstand prolonged exposure to rain or sun.

We then proceeded to the pool area, where we noticed that the color in the photos Ms. Zarina sent was not accurate compared to the actual colors. As a result, we chose another color, and they picked Liso Verde. I left swatches of Turkis and Bombay for other options.
I proceeded to measure the sunloungers and emphasized the use of the best fabric and foam for outdoor use in our cushions. I also pointed out that the umbrella cover they were using was from our company.

We met with Ms. Susan at the executive meeting room and began our product presentation. We informed her that we only have a limited stock of Sunbrella fabrics, as we are now the exclusive distributor of Agora Upholstery Fabric. We presented the color card of Agora Fabrics and Ms. Susan found it interesting.

In addition to Agora Fabrics, we also showed her our Acrisol Collection and highlighted the fabrics that we have in stock. She expressed interest in using the Acrisol Collection for throw pillow accents.

We also introduced our Solcryl Upholstery Fabric and discussed its affordability and large stock availability in Taguig.

Furthermore, we showcased our Suniture products, which range from umbrellas to placemats. Ms. Susan was particularly interested in the umbrellas and expressed that she would keep our communication for future requirements.

During our meeting, we confidently introduced our Suniture products, notably highlighting our OUTDOOR FABRIC - Agora Fabrics. While discussing the water repellency feature, Mr. Sa'u expressed some concerns, but we took the opportunity to thoroughly explain the fabric's standard water resistance capacity.

Moreover, we showcased an array of Suniture products, ranging from Umbrellas to Sunbuns, and provided a detailed presentation of our successful projects, particularly emphasizing our collaborations with Hilton Hotels, especially in Thailand.

In an effort to demonstrate our commitment and confidence in our products, we assured them of our willingness to provide complimentary samples of our cushions.

She did find the Bitex Cancun Collection interesting, and she allowed me to show her the desired theme for their outdoor, which is more of an aqua shade with printed throw pillows and plain cushions.

While I have recommended her to select from the Agora Plain Collection - for their cushions and Acrisol Collection, and Bitex Collection for their throw pillows.

She informed me that she will be meeting with her general manager immediately to present and select fabrics for their outdoor furniture from our outdoor fabric collections.

Visit By Roseanne","Eco Resort Management develops the Banwa Private Island Resort. This resort is not yet fully operational until next year as they need to comply all the goverment requirements. And for the record Banwa Island is the most expensive resort as you need to expense 5 million per night to rent out the whole island itself with the use of chopper and yacht to do island hopping.


Prior on my visit Mr. Henry Domasig the Acting General Manager on the resort called me to inquire if we can supply cushion on their two speedboats. So they are the one who settle my itinerary expense from Cebu to their resort. I spent 2 days on their resort.

First Day: to do the measurement of their one speedboat on cushions and bimini top and the other day is the second speed boat.

*I did also introduce them our finished products and our new collection brand of fabrics.

They need also 4 pcs of umbrellas using SOLCRYL FABRIC Awning & Marine and SAIL SHADE for their 6 villas.


* I met also Ms. Myrna, their housekeeping manager, as per Ms. Myrna, they will also let us do the cover replacements of their cushions but she needs to consolidate first all the furnitures that needed those cover replacements.",,2,hjdomasig@banwaprivateisland.com,Henry Joseph Domasig,

Mr. Magabilin is my previous contact person when it comes to their umbrella requirements. Hence, their last requirement for center pole square umbrellas were put on hold up until now. Also, Sir Magabilin is now transferred to the engineering department.

Ms. Bruno on the other hand is my contact person when it comes to the cushions and we got their first order last March. Now, their new requirement will be fabrics for cover replacement of their old cushions. I have introduced to her Solcryl and informed her that whatever they have chosen from the Sunbrella collection, will give them alternative from our Solcryl collection.

Visit By Roseanne","During my visit to FYI Designed Studio, a bespoke and curated design studio in Cebu City, I had the opportunity to meet with Architect Carl Evan Saycon and his assistant Ms. Dylan. FYI Designed Studio specializes in providing tailored design solutions, development strategies, and opportunities to forward-thinking real estate developers in the Philippines.

During our meeting, I presented our company's offerings to Architect Carl and discussed how they could be of value to FIY Designed Studio's clients. I introduced him to our Agora Outdoor Fabrics, which I explained was an ideal choice for resorts and hotels used for outdoor furniture.

Architect Carl expressed interest in our Sauleda Nautic and Solcryl Awning & Marine products, as he was specifically interested in shading fabrics. I highlighted that these products have a 10-year warranty against fading and other features that make them a great choice for outdoor use.

Next, I showed him our brochures and explained the features of our Eqodry Foam, which is a high-quality foam that is perfect for outdoor cushions and furniture.

Finally, I introduced him to our Suniture products and discussed some of our big clients in Cebu, particularly those who have purchased our umbrellas.","Sample Left:

Mr. Gilbert D. Capada

Visit By Roseanne","JMDC, renowned for its development of JY Square Mall and IT Center, recently partnered with Marriott International under Prestigio, Inc., for the establishment of the first Fairfield by Marriott hotel in Cebu.

Eager to explore opportunities with this new establishment, I paid a visit to the hotel in its early phase. Upon arrival, I learned from Mr. Jayson at the front office that the hotel was not yet fully operational, scheduled for an opening in December. Seeking a contact for proposal discussions, I mentioned our supplier history with Mariott Manila and Sheraton Cebu. Mr. Jayson connected me with Mr. Capada from the purchasing department, who graciously accommodated me.

In our conversation, I inquired about their outdoor amenities, specifically focusing on swimming pools or other outdoor facilities. Mr. Capada mentioned they had such amenities on higher floors but were not operational yet. When discussing outdoor essentials like umbrellas and sun loungers, he informed me they hadn't acquired umbrellas yet. This led to me presenting the comprehensive Suniture Outdoor Collections, showcasing our range of products. Additionally, I introduced our Outdoor Fabrics and provided insight into the anatomy of our cushions.

Expressing interest, Mr. Capada requested samples.","And also I did introduce him our placemats swatches and our December On-sale Items.

He just told me that he will present it to the department involve and he will contact me soon.

They offer management services to some of the hotels in the Philippines.

I ask Mr. Bong if how long they will manage their client, he told me that it depends on them but some of their clients they manage for almost 5 years. They just transferred 2 days ago on the second floor of the said building.

Mr. Bong said that sometimes they are the one who look for the supplier for their client's need. He will present our products to their client.","-provide him with our brochure for his reference.

He told me that he will submit our brochures to their designer which as of that moment he was not around. He doesn't have any idea for the size of their parasol. He asked me If I can go back anytime once their designer is available to discuss our products and I said yes.

He will inform me the availability of the person in charge for their umbrellas.",-keep in touch,2,efren.aspili@ph.mcd.com,Mr. Efren Aspili,

Ms. My Dy Ferrer

Visit By Roseanne","I had the pleasure of visiting Golden Prince Hotel and meeting with Ms. My Dy Ferrer from the Purchasing department. The purpose of the visit was to make a quick presentation of our Suniture products, with a focus on our outdoor umbrellas, showcase our placemat swatches, and have a discussion regarding our Agora Fabric.

In addition to the presentation, we engaged in a discussion regarding our Agora Fabric. I explained the features and benefits of the fabric, including its resistance to UV rays, fading, and harsh weather elements. I highlighted the wide range of color options available.

Ms. My Dy Ferrer showed great interest in our Suniture products, particularly our outdoor umbrellas, as well as our placemat options. She appreciated the quality and design of our umbrellas and recognized the potential they hold in enhancing the hotel's outdoor areas. She also expressed interest for the variety of fabric colors offered under the Agora Fabric range.

Follow-up actions will include remaining available to address any further inquiries or requests for information.","Marketing Materials Left:

Visit By Jina Hackett","Joint Visit with Ms. Yen and Kuya Louie.

Since we finished with Admiral Hotel measurements late than we expected, I advised Sir Dennis that we will be arriving at their Hotel around 2PM for the measurement scheduled arranged.

Visited and Met Sir Dennis. Quickly introduced Sir Dennis with Kuya Louie and Sir Dennis greeted us all. Sir Dennis brought us all to the Umbrellas Areas. He showed and instructed Kuya Louie the areas of the umbrellas to measure and asked someone to assist us for the measurement and he told us that he will meet us back at his office area after we're done with the measurements.

Kuya Louie started the measurement and made the drawings to illustrate the details and quickly discussed with me what are the important things to remember when doing the measurement.

We then went back to Sir Dennis and showed him the swatches and told us to send quotations for Sauleda and Solcryl Nautic to have the comparison in line of the cost.

Presented him the Sauleda Natural and Solcryl Natural as he mentioned that the color should be lighter than the current existing fabric of the umbrella.

Also mention to expedite the accreditation documents for compliance as a vendor or supplier to their hotel.","Prioritize the accreditation.

Since we saw that they have an existing umbrella in their pool area we mentioned to her that if their frame is okay we can do the cover replacement and she said okay.

Ar. Mae Garcia is handling the JW Marriott Panglao Bohol Project, which is still in the design stage. The project is currently on its third revision, as it has yet to receive approval from JW Marriott Management. They are aiming to start construction in the second quarter of next year.

Discussion Summary
Product Presentation: I presented our Suniture products and provided the technical data sheets, explaining the details of our Umbrellas, Cushions, Cabanas, Fabrics, Foam, Accessories, and KF Flooring. She was more interested on this.

Accreditation: I emphasized that Suniture has previously supplied JW Marriott Thailand. Ar. Garcia appreciated this, noting that JW Marriott and Sheraton have different standards for accreditation. If we supplied JW Mariott Hotels is an advantage to us.

Next Steps: Ar. Garcia requested a letter confirming that Suniture has supplied products to JW Marriott Thailand in any forms of letter of confirmation. This letter will help include our products on their approved list for the project.

Follow-Up
Prepare and send the requested letter confirming Suniture's supply to JW Marriott Thailand.

I also showed her the sample of our cushions and beanbags she is quite interested as I mentioned the warranties.

I showed them the Solcryl Awning & Marine Fabric since their resort theme is a four-color theme (Orange, Yellow, Blue and Green) so I recommend them the fabric since they are budget-concious I mentioned them the warranty and it's much cheaper from the previous quote I have sent to them (since it was a Sunbrella).

They requested me to requote it and also they are interested with the beanbags for their beach front. (waiting to finalize what size they'll be needing. Though I recommend also the pyramats and rollingmats on-sale still they preferred the beanbags.

I have connected with Ms. Maya through Ms. Leny Arvisu - our client before who ask for quotation on Umbrella Cover Replacement and the said cover is for Mariott Hotel. Ms. Leny just forwarded our quotation to Mariott as she don't want to meddle anymore with this project.

As per conversation with Ms. Maya, they'll be needing Umbrella Cover around 5 to 6 pcs. Their first option is Sauleda Natural but since we don't have stocks they opt to choose Sauleda Oyster.

Also, introduce them a bit background of Suniture products.

We are now processing our accreditation with them so they can send P.O to us. Already completed requirements and submission.

Initially, our purpose was to introduce our Eqoshade products and assess their swimming pool shades requirements. However, our discussions took a deeper turn when Mr. Wee expressed interest in customized shades that fell beyond the scope of our Eqoshade offerings. I took the opportunity to explain that while we specialize in Eqoshade products, the specific customization he sought wasn't within our expertise.

Subsequently, I communicated to Ms. Rachel that we might need to decline the customized shade project. Instead, I suggested the possibility of focusing on proposing our umbrellas, aligning more closely with our expertise and product range.

Explained to the Engineering team that the model FLO30 Hanging Umbrella base weight is 120 kilograms and since our company is specialized for outdoor furniture's and parasols with best product quality and product warranty as well as the availability of customization of the color preferences for the cover. We slightly provided safety tips when there's heavy wind and storms to ensure the long service of the product.",,2,parkwest.fpmc@gmail.com,Ms. Mitch Cando,

Visit By Rosa Lee","One of the interior designers of Sheraton hotel is from EMESAE DESIGN (see also my VRs from EMESAE Design) The designer I used to visit has been assigned in OKADA Hotel or Tiger Resort Hotel, so I met a new person Ms. Liz. I followed up from Ms. Liz the swatch fabric (Cabana regatta) which was asked by Pauline Anne Tianzon . Liz told me that they do not have outdoor area project for Sheraton. However, she said she will check with Pauline. Sheraton is in construction phase now, target opening will be in 2018. I also learned that Marriott Clark Pampanga project will also be handled by EMESEA Design. They require big sizes of furniture fabric samples/swatches, informed Liz that we have scrap materials to be used as sampled for her material board.

Visit By Jina Hackett","Visited Sofitel Manila and Met Sir Herman with warm welcoming smile, made a quick introduction of the transition with handling of their accounts.

I presented the Sauleda Fabric for the cover replacement of their existing umbrella. Client also asked for the swatches of Sauleda to leave as he needs to present it for approval for final color of the fabric. He mentioned that most probably within his selection between the oyster and natural, it would be natural as other existing umbrella covers are lighter color. He also asked me to check the cabana that needs to cover at the poolside along the 3 pieces umbrella with old dark blue covers.

Sir Herman endorsed me to Ma'am Glenda and Sir Ronnel from housekeeping department to assist me to the locations of umbrella's and cabana. After checking, Ma'am Glenda and Sir Ronnel said that cabana's are urgently needed to cover same color of the fabric for umbrella. Told them that we will give them respond about cabana covers as soon as possible.

I was asked to go back to Sir Herman, I asked him if they have other requirements or projects and he mentioned and showed the sample swatches of leatherette for 4 seaters sofa. He asked for a quotation for natural sauleda fabric for the cover replacement of the umbrellas.

During the meeting, I presented the features and benefits of our products, emphasizing the durability, versatility, and aesthetic appeal of our Agora Fabric. I also highlighted the quality and performance of our Outdoor Foam, specifically addressing Ms. Mia's requirement for a foam that can withstand exposure to weather conditions without the need for constant protection.

However, Ms. Mia informed me that they already have a supplier that offers them a 10-year warranty for their current outdoor furniture. While she expressed interest in our Outdoor Foam, she explained that they have a pre-existing agreement with their supplier. Nevertheless, she appreciated the information and expressed gratitude for the introduction to our products.

We discussed the potential for future collaboration and agreed to keep in touch should their needs change or if they require additional products in the future. I provided Ms. Mia with our contact information and assured her that we would be happy to assist with any future inquiries or projects.","Marketing Matrls Left:

During our discussion, we proposed an alternative solution: replacing the current frame with a Teak-colored fiberglass one, considering their order for Black 38mm frames. Mr. Jin, after consulting the management, approved this alteration.

1. So their Parasols are from First Pinnacle, bought last 2014 for roughly 15k for aluminium with cover similar to Sunbrella's Aruba. As per Sir Mark, some of the covers were faded already. Also informed him that with Sunbrella fabric they can wash it bleach unlike the fabric used by First Pinnacle.

Visit By Dustin","I visited Ms. Laarni of TRYP. As per our Viber conversation, she is requesting an umbrella replacement to be placed in their pool area on the 19th floor. She wants a movable umbrella because, at night, they turn their pool area into a bar. I presented and showed her different types of umbrellas, sizes, and shapes, whether round or square, with center poles or hanging. However, I mentioned that hanging umbrellas don't have wheels on the base, so they need to be manually lifted to be moved. I showed her our bases with wheels. The client decided to choose the bases with wheels and a square canopy with taupe fabric, 3 meters in size, so the two sun loungers can fit under it. I also showed her other products in the catalogue, but her priority right now is the umbrellas. I presented the Agora collection for upholstery made for outdoor, mentioning that it is best used for seat covers and cushions due to the water repellency of the fabric and resistant to fading especially when combined with the outdoor foam we have. I showed her the structure of the cushion/seat loungers. She said she would include that in their next budget. She is requesting a quotation for six square umbrellas.",,2,Idcaralian@microtel.ph | laarni.caralian@TRYP.ph,Ms. Laarni D. Caralian,

When I arrived at their place she introduced me to Ms. Kate Bliss (operation manager). Ms. Kate is the wife of Mr. Greg Bliss who is the CEO of Tanawin.

I introduced to them our products and services. I did not talked much about sunbrella because Ms. Kate knows about it. She was interested in the parasol umbrella which they didn't have right now. She said she will get 3 sets of AUS 30 with oyster cover first quarter next year.

She wants also to put a cushion on their sun loungers for she said it is not comfortable when she sits. She introduced me to her husband Mr. Greg Bliss.

She said to wait for a while because her friend has sun lounger at their house which she wants to replace the cover. After a while her friend arrived and she introduced me to Ms. Evelyn Anderson. She was so very happy when she saw our colored card. She said she love sunbrella very much.

Ms. Evelyn told me that she will contact me once she's in Manila to visit our warehouse. Ms. Kate also introduced me Andria Hooper. Ms. Hooper is interested in our bean bag for her little boy.

Ms. Sarah showed me the pool area where the umbrellas are located. The requested umbrella color of the cover is Sauleda Pacific Blue, which closely matches their existing umbrellas. The final quantity for cover replacements and a complete set is pending confirmation from their main office in Manila. We are currently awaiting their response.

Fabrics:
Ms. Sarah requested that I send fabric swatches directly to their Manila office. The approving head for fabric selection will be based there.

Placemats:
Regarding placemats, Ms. Sarah informed me that the company has forwarded the selection options to upper management for their additional order. The exact choices of placemat designs have not been finalized yet.

Materials send to their main office:
1. CC - Lines Rayure, Abaco, Exodo and Simmetria","Updates:
Since the visit, I received an update from Ms. Lorna, our main contact in Manila. The final fabric choices have not been confirmed yet, as they are awaiting approval from upper management.

Regarding placemats, an order for 207 pieces has already been placed.

For umbrellas, we are still following up to gather their final requirements and ensure a smooth process.",6,svidaurrazaga@thebellevuebohol.com,Shirley T. Vidaurrazaga,Ms. Shirley T. Vidaurrazaga

AUBREY CRISOSTOMO

Visit By Christina","Supposed to drop by their office for a product presentation after sending our available products but as per Ms. Aubrey's instruction, better to see their actual parasols first as they don't have available sample in their office. They also thought that the parasols previously supplied to them are Sunbrella Branded, so informed them that Sunbrella is the brand of the fabric not literally the umbrella.

So going back with the site visit from one of their branches, check out their UP Town Mall branch and saw the umbrellas with the Sunbrella label sewn on it but for my judgement, the fabric used is not Sunbrella (have to double check though). Checked the whole umbrella but cant find any details about the supplier.",--- update Ms. Aubrey that we can supply umbrellas even better that what they currently have -- struggle on this is the printing of their logo -- have to source out,2,aubrey.crisostomo@coffeebean.com.ph,AUBREY CRISOSTOMO,

During our discussion they ask if we can customize furniture to them since they saw at the outdoor contract collection that we have outdoor furniture, but we said that if they want we can only customize the cushion of the furniture or if they really want use the Eqodry for their furniture they can purchased to us the foam and the cover. Ms. Alex also told that they are looking for the outdoor foam for they previous project but they dont like the one that is being supplied by the local supplier.
